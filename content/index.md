## Welcome to Trinity Scouts!

We’re so glad you’re here to learn more about our scouts Montreal group or Scouts Canada in general.  We love the Scouting life and we’re sure you will too!

Our scouts Montreal group has been active for more than 100 years and at the same location for all that time. Pretty cool to have that much history, right?

Learn more about our Trinity group HERE.
