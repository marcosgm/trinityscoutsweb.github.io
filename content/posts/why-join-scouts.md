## Why Join Scouts

Is Scouting right for you or your child? Learn all about Scouts Canada here.

Scouts Canada welcomes boys and girls ages five and up to join their Canadian Path program designed for youth to:

- experience new things,
- have more adventures,
- develop into confident and capable individuals,
- and be better prepared for success in the world.

## What makes the Canadian Path so special?

Youth get to decide on the programs they will follow, what we call a youth-led program. With adult Scout supervision, youth take charge and organize methods to reach their goals and afterwards together review their experiences in what is called “Plan-Do-Review.” This method can help youth:

- develop into critical thinkers,
- further their personal progression,
- and participate in inclusive team building.

## Scout Sections

Youth are divided up by age into the various Scouting sections so they can work together as a team to accomplish age appropriate goals.

Beavers (Ages 5-7) – Children in this group are all new to Scouting. Beavers will have lots of fun playing games and making friends as they learn about camping, hiking, and making camp fires.
